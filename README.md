# apir
## Easy API Access

apir is a library and command-line tool that allows easy access to APIs.

It works like this:
  You specify (in yaml/ruby) your api address, the endpoints, and any credentials needed.
  apir will generate you an object with methods for all your api calls.
  apir will also offer a cli to this object.

apir provides a better interface to apis for testing, either programmatically or from the command line.
